To investigate the impact of outstanding debt on credit scores, you can use several visualization techniques to uncover patterns and insights. Here are some suggestions:
1. Scatter Plots

    - Basic Scatter Plot: Plot outstanding_debt on the x-axis and credit_score on the y-axis to see the overall relationship.
    - Colored by Credit Score: Color the points by credit_score category to differentiate between poor, standard, and good scores.
    - Faceted Scatter Plot: Use facet_wrap or facet_grid to create separate scatter plots for different ranges of another variable like interest_rate or num_of_loan.

2. Box Plots

    - Box Plot by Credit Score: Create box plots of outstanding_debt for each credit_score category. This shows the distribution and central tendency of debt for each score category.
    - Box Plot Faceted by Another Variable: Facet the box plots by num_of_loan or interest_rate to compare distributions across different conditions.

3. Density Plots

    - Density Plot by Credit Score: Overlay density plots for outstanding_debt for each credit_score category. This helps in comparing the distribution shapes.
    - Faceted Density Plot: Create faceted density plots for different ranges of another variable to see how the density of outstanding_debt varies with credit_score.

4. Histograms

    - Histogram by Credit Score: Create histograms of outstanding_debt for each credit_score category. This shows the frequency distribution of debt amounts.
    - Stacked Histograms: Use stacked histograms to compare distributions within the same plot.

5. Violin Plots

    - Violin Plot by Credit Score: Violin plots combine box plots and density plots, showing both the distribution shape and summary statistics for outstanding_debt across different credit scores.

6. Heatmaps

    - Correlation Heatmap: Create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between outstanding_debt and other numerical variables, including credit_score.
    - 2D Density Heatmap: Plot a 2D density heatmap of outstanding_debt vs. credit_score to see where the most common combinations occur.

7. Line Charts

    - Trend Lines: If you have a time series component (like Month), plot the trend of outstanding_debt over time, colored by credit_score.

8. Bar Charts

    - Grouped Bar Charts: Use grouped bar charts to show the average or median outstanding_debt for each credit_score category, possibly grouped by another variable like occupation or num_of_loan.

9. Pair Plots

    - Pair Plot: Create a pair plot to see scatter plots, histograms, and correlation values for outstanding_debt, credit_score, and other relevant variables in the dataset.

10. Bubble Charts

    - Bubble Chart: Use a bubble chart where the x-axis is outstanding_debt, the y-axis is credit_score, and the size of the bubbles represents another variable like num_of_loan or annual_income.

11. Facet Grids

    - Facet Grid by Two Variables: Create a facet grid to plot outstanding_debt against credit_score across combinations of two other categorical variables, such as occupation and num_of_loan.

12. Crosstab Analysis

    - Crosstab Heatmap: Create a heatmap of a crosstab showing the count or percentage of observations for combinations of credit_score and outstanding_debt ranges.

By using these visualization techniques, you can explore different aspects of the relationship between outstanding debt and credit scores, identify trends, and gain insights into how outstanding debt impacts credit scores across various conditions and demographics.
